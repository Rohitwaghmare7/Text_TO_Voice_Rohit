The project "Text-to-Speech converter" was developed by me as a mini-project in our college. The basic aim is to 
convert the given text into speech output. We have build a mobile application for converting text-to-speech as well 
as speech-to-text.We have developed this application using Flutter. The functionalities of our application are:-

- Converting text input to speech output. (TTS conversion)
- Converting Speech input to text Output. (STT conversion)  

For building the application, we have used libraries provided by flutter to perform the required conversion. Basics 
of DART language is required to build this application.  
		Also, as the application is developed using Flutter, It can be used of multiple platforms like android, 
MACOS, web application as well as desktop application.
